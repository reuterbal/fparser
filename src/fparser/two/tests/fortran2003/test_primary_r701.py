'''Test Fortran 2003 rule R701 : primary type.

Sub-rules:
    C701 (R701) The type-param-name shall be the name of a type parameter.
    C702 (R701) The designator shall not be a whole assumed-size array

Neither C701 nor C702 can be tested here, as they require context of the
type defined outside of Primary.
